## 📜 Overview

Protein synthesis is the process by which cells create proteins based on genetic information.  
It follows the **Central Dogma of Molecular Biology**:


Proposed by **Francis Crick**, the central dogma describes the flow of information from DNA to RNA (via transcription) and from RNA to protein (via translation).  
RNA acts as a messenger carrying instructions from DNA to ribosomes.

## 🧪 Steps of Protein Synthesis

### 1️⃣ Transcription
- **Location**: Nucleus (in eukaryotes), cytoplasm (in prokaryotes).
- **Process**:
  1. Initiation – RNA polymerase binds to promoter region.
  2. Elongation – mRNA strand synthesized by complementary base pairing (A↔U, G↔C).
  3. Termination – RNA polymerase stops at terminator sequence, releasing mRNA.
- **Outcome**: mRNA transcript carrying genetic code.

---

### 2️⃣ Translation
- **Location**: Cytoplasm at ribosomes.
- **Process**:
  1. Initiation – Ribosome binds to mRNA at start codon (AUG).
  2. Elongation – tRNAs bring amino acids; ribosome forms peptide bonds.
  3. Termination – Stop codon reached; polypeptide released.
- **Outcome**: Polypeptide chain (primary protein structure).

---

### 3️⃣ Post-Translation
- Folding into a functional 3D structure.
- Possible chemical modifications (e.g., phosphorylation, glycosylation).
- Transport to functional location or secretion.

## 📌 Key Points
- **mRNA** – carries genetic code.
- **tRNA** – brings amino acids to ribosome.
- **rRNA** – structural/catalytic part of ribosome.
- **Prokaryotes** – 70S ribosomes; **Eukaryotes** – 80S ribosomes.
- Genetic code is **universal** and **degenerate**.
